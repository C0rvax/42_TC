    fastify: The core framework.

    @fastify/sensible: Adds sensible defaults (error handling, etc.).

    @fastify/cors: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (needed for your SPA frontend).

    sqlite3: The SQLite driver for Node.js.

    bcrypt: For securely hashing passwords.

    knex: A powerful SQL query builder. Makes interacting with SQLite much cleaner and safer than raw SQL strings.

    fastify-plugin: Utility for creating reusable Fastify plugins.

    @fastify/jwt: Handles JSON Web Token generation and verification for authentication.

    @fastify/cookie: Needed by @fastify/jwt if you plan to send JWTs via cookies (though Authorization header is more common for SPAs). Also useful for session-based auth if you prefer that.

    @fastify/multipart: To handle file uploads (like avatars).

    @fastify/websocket: For real-time features like online status.

    dotenv: To manage environment variables (like JWT secrets) securely.
